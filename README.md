The objective of our program is to design a juggler and also display the process of juggling As we have selected our mini-project “JUGGLING using computer graphics in C” which means a joker is playing with three balls or five balls as to complete our project we have choose graphics in C–language . To make the joker we are using different types of pre-defined functions like pieslice, circle, rectangle, line, arc, ellipse, sector etc.. by using these pre-defined we can complete our project by creating joker’s face, hands, body, cap, legs, foot, buttons, balls, eyes, nose, mouth. After creating the joker we have move from one hand of the joker to the other hand for that we are using for-loop.
